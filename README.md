# BooksSearchApp
Checkout my app to search for books from google books API.
This app lets you search for books based on keyword entered in the input tab.
Books are displayed as a grid to make it easier for users to browse through the search results.
Click on the image or the title link to learn or get more information about each book. 
Users can click on "next" and "previous" buttons to navigate through the search results.
